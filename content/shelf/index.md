I've been exploring a hybrid approach to learning that combines the depth of traditional books with the breadth of AI-generated research. Traditional books give me the foundational knowledge and deep insights from experts, while LLM-generated research books allow me to explore specific topics with comprehensive, up-to-date information synthesized from multiple sources.

I find that reading a traditional book on a topic, then diving into an LLM-researched book on a specific aspect, creates a powerful learning combination.

The following are some of the content I am currently reading or have recently read (or re-read). I am not planning to make this a comprehensive list. I will _probably_ add more as I read more.
