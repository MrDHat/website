Around 3 years back, after spending seven years an entrepreneur—I found myself at a crossroads. Having built startups, one of which was acquired, I decided to step away from the rollercoaster of entrepreneurship to explore what being an employee is like. This transition wasn’t just about changing roles; it was about navigating a shift in mindset, skillset, and priorities.

## Why I Made the Transition

The decision to move from entrepreneurship to employment was driven by two key factors. First, I wanted financial stability. Starting a new life after getting married, I yearned for a role that allowed me to focus on my family without the constant uncertainties of running a business. Second, I wanted to learn. My startups were modest in scale—not runaway successes. I was curious about how larger organizations tackle challenges, build products, and scale operations.

At Postman, for example, I joined as a technical lead for a new product that had already achieved its MVP stage. I was eager to see how a company like Postman, known for its rapid growth and innovation, managed the process of launching new products. Were big companies as slow and bureaucratic as they were rumored to be, or could they actually execute quickly and efficiently? I wanted answers, and this role gave me the chance to find them.

## First Impressions: The Entrepreneurial vs. Corporate Experience

When I moved from running my own business to joining a corporate job, I wasn’t sure what to expect. Could I adjust to a structured environment after making all the decisions myself? This change wasn’t just about a new role—it was a whole new way of thinking.

One of the starkest realizations I had during this transition was the difference in impact. As an entrepreneur, every decision I made—whether it was engineering, business, or hiring, directly affected the lives of my customers and team. The creativity I could apply to solving problems was boundless, and the sense of ownership was unparalleled.

In contrast, as an employee, especially at larger companies, the scope of influence felt significantly narrower. Opinions from roles like SDE3 or SDE4 often don’t carry as much weight in strategic decision-making. The vision typically comes from the top, and your role is to execute it. While there is room for creativity in engineering decisions, it is limited compared to the freedom of entrepreneurship.

That said, both roles require unique skillsets. As an entrepreneur, you are your own boss, setting the vision and figuring things out independently. While I thought this would translate seamlessly into corporate roles, the reality was more nuanced. My entrepreneurial skills helped in certain areas but didn’t always have the impact I had hoped for.

When I think about how my previous entrepreneurship experience helped me in my corporate role, a specific moment comes to mind, where my entrepreneurial mindset made a difference. I noticed that the project wasn’t aligning with customer values—something I’d learned as an entrepreneur could be a death trap. Drawing from my experience, I made the case for tweaks that would prioritize the customer’s needs. This intervention shifted the project in the right direction, reinforcing the value of my entrepreneurial background even in a corporate setting. There were a few more instances like this. I will hopefully write more about that later.

## The Emotional Side of Transitioning

Adapting to a role with less autonomy was one of the hardest parts of this journey. As an entrepreneur, I was used to making all the decisions; suddenly, I was in a role where my influence was limited. At times, it felt like wearing the "chains of Olympus"—bound by the constraints of hierarchy and process.

Yet, there were moments of liberation. For the first time in years, I could focus solely on building, free from the pressures of fundraising, hiring, and running the business. This duality—feeling both constrained and relieved, was a constant during my transition.

One of the biggest adjustments was recognizing that my role in a corporate job required more focus and specialization. As an entrepreneur, I was used to wearing multiple hats—handling strategy, execution, and team management all at once. In a larger organization, I had to embrace the value of collaboration and trust in others’ expertise, which was both humbling and liberating. This shift taught me to channel my adaptability and decision-making skills into areas where they made the most impact.

## A Work in Progress

My journey from entrepreneur to employee is far from over. While the transition has been challenging, it has also been rewarding. I’ve gained new perspectives, honed my skills, and learned to adapt to environments where my impact is less direct but no less significant.

For those considering a similar path, my advice is simple: embrace the change. Understand that the skills you’ve gained as an entrepreneur—resilience, problem-solving, and creativity—are invaluable, even if their application looks different in a corporate setting.

This transition is a work in progress, but it’s one I’m committed to mastering. After all, growth lies in stepping out of your comfort zone and exploring new ways to create value.
