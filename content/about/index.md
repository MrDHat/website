I'm an engineer with a passion for building things and seeing how they grow. Iâ€™ve spent over 10 years in tech, with almost 7 of those as an entrepreneur. Engineering, to me, is more than just a jobâ€”itâ€™s an art form, a way to solve problems and create something meaningful. After running startups, including one that got acquired, Iâ€™ve moved into product development roles at some exciting companies. Along the way, Iâ€™ve learned how to combine my technical skills with the lessons from entrepreneurship to create real impact.

When Iâ€™m not working, I love to travel with my wife and explore new destinations. Fun Fact: we once packed up, gave up our house, and spent a year traveling as digital nomads through places like Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Austria, Italy, Croatia and Spain. Right now, Iâ€™m based in Dubaiâ€”but who knows where weâ€™ll go next!

Iâ€™m known as mrdhat everywhere on the internet. If you'd like to reach out to me, I am at i(at)akshay.co.
